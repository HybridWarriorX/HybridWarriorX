                <b><font size="+3"><p class="w3-center w3-padding-64">WHAT IS "SONIC ADVENTURE?"</p></font></b>
                <b><font size="+2"><p>Sonic Adventure is video game created by SEGA and Sonic Team originally for the SEGA DREAMCAST and later to newer consoles as "Sonic Adventure DX. The purpose of the game is to branch off the Sonic series from the classic sidescroller platform, to a newer 3D counterpart as following the trend through the newer generation of video games with multiple characters."</p></font></b>
                <b><font size="+3"><p class="w3-center w3-padding-64">WHO ARE THE PLAYABLE CHARACTERS?</p></font></b>
                <b><font size="+2"><p>There are a total of 7 playable characters through the main 6 stories and the final story. The main characters include Sonic the hedgehog, Miles "Tails" Prower, Knuckles the echidna, Amy Rose, Big the Cat, and E-102 Gamma each with their own different stories that intertwine. Through the final story, Super Sonic is playable for the final boss against Perfect Chaos."</p></font></b>
                <b><font size="+3"><p class="w3-center w3-padding-64">WHO SINGS THE MAIN THEME?</p></font></b>
                <b><font size="+2"><p>"Open Your Heart" (the main theme of "Sonic Adventure") was sung by Crush 40 with Jun Senoue on guitar. The song plays instrumentally on the title screen as well with the lyrical version playing in the background in the final boss against Perfect Chaos.</p></font></b>
                <b><font size="+3"><p class="w3-center w3-padding-64">WHAT ARE EMBLEMS?</p></font></b>
                <b><font size="+2"><p>In "Sonic Adventure," emblems are gained after completing a stage, certain requirements or missions Once collected all emblems (a total of 130), a new character will be unlocked and will be able to play in all of Sonic's stages. (HINT: This "metal" character first appeared in Sonic CD.)"</p></font></b>
                <b><font size="+3"><p class="w3-center w3-padding-64">WHAT ARE CHAOS?</p></font></b>
                <b><font size="+2"><p>"Chaos" are digital pets that are born from eggs. Based on the character that interacts with them and how they do so, will change their appearance. In stages a character can collect items (however there is a shop for Chaos and you can use rings you've collected from your journey) and animals to boost their Chaos stats as well as their appearance and can play minigames with them such as karate, racing, and school. There are also 3 known locations of the Chao Garden located in Mystic Ruins, the Station Square Hotel, and in the Egg Carrier. Sonic Team incorporated Chao into the games to encourage players to explore levels and support the goodâ€“evil dichotomy of Sonic Adventure. Any chao from "Sonic Adventure" can be transported to the Game Boy Advance game, "Sonic Advance" through the GBA station in the "Chao Garden."</p></font></b>
