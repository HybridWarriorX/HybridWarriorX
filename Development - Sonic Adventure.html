                <b><font size="+2"><p>The development of Sonic Adventure began around April 1997 with a development team of thirty members. After developing several titles for the Sega Genesis, producer Yuji Naka worked mainly on the game Nights into Dreams for the Sega Saturn. Sonic Team started to work on an original 3D Sonic title for the Saturn, but development was ultimately shifted to the Dreamcast; according to Naka, remnants of the project can be seen in the compilation Sonic Jam. The development team focused on graphics and high resolution for this game, with Naka reflecting that we have pushed the Dreamcast "as far as we can at present".</p></font></b>

                <b><font size="+2"><p>Director Takashi Iizuka, having developed Nights into Dreams, proposed to Naka that they should develop a role-playing video game-style/RPG Sonic game. In order to achieve a more natural, realistic feel to the exotic levels like ruins and jungles, the core members of the Sonic Team traveled to Central America and South America. The Teams journey began in the northern part of the peninsula in a place called Chichen Itza, from there the team traveled southward along the Eastern side of the Peninsula where they also visited Cancun, Tulum and finally Tikal. The team then left the peninsula traveling down through Central America, into South America, Peru, where they visited Cuzco, Mache Picchu and then Ica. Chichen Itza and Tikal provided the aesthetics concept of the Shrine of Knuckles's race, Chaos and the serpents drawing on the walls of the temple, Cancun and Tulum provided the concept of Emerald Coast, Cuzco provided the the Chaos Emerald Altar, Macho Picchu provided the design of Windy Valley and finally Ica provided the the aesthetics for the Tails sandboarding stage. However, the trip was not all fun and games, the team having unexpected encounters with giant spiders, snakes, and reportedly Yuji Naka becoming ill at one point. At the end of it all, the team returned to Japan in one piece, full of enthusiasm to create the game.</p></font></b>

                <b><font size="+2"><p>Naka aimed to create levels that would take the player at least five minutes to complete, yet retain similar gameplay to the Mega Drive titles. Following the creation of the basic level maps, Naka wondered "why don't we use this map for other characters?" also during development many wrote into Sega, requesting a new character that would shoot enemies. Sega thought that giving the characters a gun would be odd, the development team also wanted to break up the intense action. These led to the introduction of Big and E-102. One final element that Iizuka wanted to have in the game was an enemy that was completely separate from Eggman, and also something which, up until then, was impossible to create in a game. Wanting something liquid and transparent, the character of Chaos was thought up. Presenting the original concept art and idea to Naka, Chaos was approved on the spot, his role in the game cemented. </p></font></b>

                <b><font size="+2"><p>Chaos' ever-shifting nature and demeanor was something the team wanted to advertise, placing the character in the very first playable sequence in the game. The development team conducted surveys of fans to ensure that the final product, especially the characters, would please them. The character of Sonic was redesigned for the game by Sonic Team artist Yuji Uekawa, with longer legs and spines that Iizuka subsequently noted were more suitable for 3D than Sonic's original and more compact design, which was meant to be seen from the side. Certain levels, such as "Lost World and Windy Valley," were rebuilt dozens of times. Sega made it a top priority to keep the game a secret until shortly before its release. Despite these efforts, screenshots were leaked onto the Internet in mid-1998. Naka presented the game to Edge in mid-August, and official announcement fell on August 22 in Japan.</p></font></b>

                <b><font size="+2"><p>After the game's release in Japan, Sega and Sonic Team knew the game was not as finished as they would have liked it to be so, In February 1999, Sega's vice president Tadahiko Hirose announced that a more completed version of Sonic Adventure would be released along with Virtua Fighter 3tb and Sega Rally 2 as launch titles for the Dreamcast's international release. In June 1999, Sega announced that Sonic Adventure would be one of the five titles in the Dreamcast's "Masterpiece Collection". The North American version of the game includes Japanese and English-language audio tracks, as well as Japanese, English, Spanish, French and German subtitles. Online gameplay and downloadable content were also added for the localization.</p></font></b>
