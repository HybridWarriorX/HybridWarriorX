               <b><p>Sonic's adventure begins In Station Square, Sonic witnesses a stand-off between the Station Square Police Department and a mysterious water monster. The police open fire on the monster only for their bullets to simply bounce off of it and fall to the ground. Seeing that their weapons are useless, all personnel retreat. Sonic battles the monster, but it escapes through a water drain, leaving a puzzled Sonic staring at the drain. Overlooking these events from a high up rooftop is none other than the evil Dr. Robotnik.

The next day while relaxing by a pool Sonic sees a plane spinning out of control in the sky. Upon further examination, Sonic realizes the plane's pilot is none other than Tails! Tails crashes into Emerald Coast, Sonic races off to rescue his little buddy. Tails reveals that his new plane is powered by a Chaos Emerald. Tails asks Sonic to come with him to his workshop in the Mystic Ruins so that he can show him something he's been working on. Sonic and Tails travel to the workshop, however, Robotnik shows up in his new Egg Hornet and demands that Sonic and Tails hand over the Chaos Emerald. He was defeated but he could still steal the Chaos Emerald that they had, and reveals Chaos, the monster Sonic fought earlier. He explains that every time he feeds Chaos one of the Chaos Emeralds, its power will be absorbed by Chaos.

               <b><p>Tails and Sonic head to the Windy Valley and Casinopolis to collect two more Emeralds; however, one of them is taken by Eggman. They head to the Mystic Ruins to collect another Emerald. Upon leaving Icecap, they encounter Knuckles. Due to a misunderstanding, Tails and Knuckles fight. Eggman, taking advantage of the situation, snatches away the Emeralds, giving them to Chaos. After a battle with Chaos 4, Eggman escapes in his Egg Carrier. Tails and Sonic give chase in the Tornado, but the Tornado gets shot down in the process. Tails lands in Mystic Ruins, only to find out that Sonic is missing and the train workers are on strike (cutting off access to Station Square). After a flashback about the "good old days", Tails decides to do without Sonic and ventures into the jungle in search for a Chaos Emerald to rebuild the Tornado. He finds a red emerald here, but runs into Big's friend, Froggy (with Chaos' tail), which swallows it. After giving chase through the Sand Hill, Tails catches up with Froggy, but is taken back in time and meets Tikal. When returned to the present, Big accidentally gives Tails a shock, causing him to lose grip of Froggy as a result.</p></b>

               <b><p>As Knuckles the Echidna rests beside the Master Emerald thinking over the story of his life, he wakes up to find Chaos next to the shattered Master Emerald. Unaware that this is Eggman's doing, Knuckles assumes that Chaos is behind the shattering of the Emerald and goes on to attack it. However, the beast blindsides him and escapes, and suddenly Angel Island falls into the sea next to the Mystic Ruins. Knuckles arrives in Station Square to find the pieces of the Master Emerald. He finds a few pieces in Speed Highway and Casinopolis, but is flashed into the past to a place he's never seen before (but is somehow familiar to him.) He overhears Tikal trying to stop her father, Pachacamac, from invading someone's "sacred grounds," but returns to the present before getting the details. He then spots Eggman heading into an elevator in the hotel. He notices the shine in Eggman's hand and believes it to be a piece of the Master Emerald so he follows Eggman. Knuckles then gets into a fight with Chaos 2, and after winning the battle, Eggman tells Knuckles that Sonic is after the emerald pieces. This gets to Knuckles, wondering why the blue blur would want them. He then heads into the jungle (where a power-up is found). Knuckles heads to Red Mountain and finds three more shards. A few minutes later, Knuckles finds Sonic and the two duke it out. But it was all a trick from Eggman so he could nab the two emeralds they had.</p></b>

               <b><p>Amy Rose is taking a stroll in Station Square, reminiscing about the good old days when suddenly the city is shadowed by the Egg Carrier and a bird falls down from the sky. The bird was held captive, along with its family. Amy befriends the bird,who she nicknames "Birdie", and promises she'll help it get home with its family. After a stroll through the town, she runs into Sonic and asks him to guard the bird, though Sonic strongly declines. She follows him to the entrance of Twinkle Park. Unfortunately, ZERO appears and before Sonic can do battle with it, Amy notices a sign that apparently says "Cute Couples get in free" and readily enters the park while Sonic follows trying to stop her. After making her way through Twinkle Park while avoiding ZERO, she makes it back to Station Square and finds Sonic gone. Before she can continue with her search, she is captured by ZERO.Amy is taken to a cell aboard the Egg Carrier where she is guarded by E-102 Gamma. He demands she hand him the bird, but she refuses. She then demands that he tell her why he wants the bird, but he himself does not know. She pleads with Gamma to help them, but he questions why she cares for something she knows nothing about. She says she pities him because love is not a part of his programming. The bird flies out of the jail cell and looks Gamma in the eyes. Gamma then tells them to escape and deactivates the cell. He tells them it is dangerous and that they'll be at the Mystic Ruins base soon. She comes to a room and plays through a game where she gets the Warrior's Feather. While venturing through Hot Shelter, she has another run-in with ZERO. When she grabs a hold of the balloon, she drifts back in time and meets Tikal after finding Chaos' Shrine. She then drifts back into the Egg Carrier. She makes it to the deck and is cornered by Eggman. Fortunately, Sonic and Tails also make it to the deck.</p></b>

               <b><p>Big the Cat is sleeping on his bed when Froggy, his best friend, awakens and spots Chaos. Froggy bites off Chaos' tail causing him to grow his own tail. Big wakes up and is worried about Froggy, who is driven insane by the possession. Froggy devours a Chaos Emerald (which Big calls his lucky charm) and runs away, with a worried Big following. When the sun rises, Big finds himself in Station Square, where he sees the crazed Froggy go in the sewers. He hoists a black car, and follows Froggy to Twinkle Park. Big manages to fish Froggy out, but the crazed amphibian retreats. Big soon finds a key to Icecap, grabs a Life Belt and heads into the icy area. He fished Froggy out, but Froggy, due to insanity, takes off. Big heads towards the Emerald Coast and finds Froggy on one part of the Great Sea. After fishing him out, Big turns to go home, but Gamma grabs the crazed frog from Big and heads back, with the worried feline pleading behind. Big boards the Egg Carrier, and tries to pick up Froggy's scent, but fails, so he decides to find him in the Hot Shelter. He realizes that to get Froggy out, He must activate the switch. After doing this and fishing Froggy out for the last time, Big turns to exit, but is transported to the past. He encounters Tikal for the first time and returns to his normal time.</p></b>

               <b><p>Dr. Eggman introduces himself to the second robot in the E-100 series, E-102 Gamma, who awakens. His training involves Gamma seeking and searing the Sonic doll in Final Egg. After that, Eggman introduces Gamma to his older brother, E-101 Beta, and pits them to a small duel. Gamma achieves victory, but Beta boards the Egg Carrier for repairs and an Level Up Item. The fortress flies off into the skies. A moment later, Eggman announces to Gamma and his younger brothers, E-103 Delta, E-104 Epsilon and E-105 Zeta, to find and capture Froggy, who's been driven insane by Chaos' tail and has eaten a Chaos Emerald. Gamma heads to the Emerald Coast, grabs Froggy and is about to return when a blinding flash takes him back in time. He tries to figure his location, but it doesn't work. He heads to the alter and lowers his cannon at the presence of the Chao. Tikal rushes to their aid, but she realizes Gamma's not part of the Knuckles clan and gives him some helpful information about the Chaos Emeralds, the Chao and their draconian protector, Chaos, before Gamma reverts to his time.</p></b>
